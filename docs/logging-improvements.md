# Logging System Improvements

## Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive logging infrastructure to improve debugging, error handling, and system observability in the Calendar application. The new system provides standardized logging throughout the application, with environment-specific configurations and enhanced features.

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Core Logging System**
   - `src/utils/logger.ts` - Enhanced logger implementation
   - `src/config/environment.ts` - Environment-specific configurations
   - `src/utils/initializeLogger.ts` - Logger initialization at application startup

2. **Error Handling Integration**
   - `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Custom error classes and error handling utilities
   - `src/presentation/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - React error boundary component

3. **Specialized Loggers**
   - `src/presentation/services/storageLogger.ts` - Storage-specific logging utilities

4. **Documentation**
   - `docs/logging-system.md` - Detailed documentation on the logging system

5. **Integration**
   - `src/main.tsx` - Logger initialization at application startup
   - `src/App.tsx` - Error boundary integration

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Logger Class
- Added support for configurable log levels
- Implemented formatted timestamps with multiple format options
- Added colorized console output for development
- Created structured JSON logging for production environments
- Added context and request ID tracking capabilities

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration
- Created environment-specific logging configurations
- Implemented different log levels by environment:
  - `DEBUG` level for development
  - `INFO` level for production
  - Disabled logs for testing by default

### 3. Error Handling Integration
- Created custom error classes for different error types
- Implemented centralized error handling with logging
- Added error formatting for better readability in logs
- Integrated with React via error boundaries

### 4. Domain-Specific Logging
- Implemented a system for creating domain-specific loggers
- Created context-aware loggers for different application domains
- Added specialized logging functions for common operations

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Added utilities for tracking operation performance
- Implemented automatic performance logging
- Created helper functions for measuring database operations

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Standardized logging format across the application
2. **Debuggability**: Enhanced logging detail in development environments
3. **Observability**: Better insight into application behavior and errors
4. **Error Tracking**: Improved error capture and contextual information
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Ability to track and optimize slow operations
6. **Contextual Information**: Domain-specific loggers provide relevant context
7. **Machine Parseability**: Structured logging in production for easier parsing
8. **Extensibility**: Easy-to-extend system for adding specialized loggers

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with external logging services (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
2. Add log rotation and file output for server environments
3. Create a log viewer component for the application
4. Implement log filtering and search capabilities
5. Add automatic error grouping and analysis
6. Create analytics integration for error tracking
